Sensor board

This board is been equipped with connectors for three HC04 ultrasonic sensors, for a MPU 6050 gyroscope sensor and for two encoders; all that controlled by an arduino pro micro that receives the data and sends it via I2C to the main controller in the motor board. It has some extra connectors to link possible future sensors. Its dimensions are 
It’s fitted into a PLA-made box in which most of the sensors are kept. The box has from one to three holes in each side designed to fit in the HC04 and a motor as well as an extra hole to make the arduino cable able to reach the pro micro connector. It has been designed to be compatible with Lego, so it could be used as a functional piece. Its dimensions are 87.80mm x 32.80mm x 71.80mm.
