Sensor board

This board has been equipped with connectors for three HC04 ultrasonic sensors, for a MPU 6050 gyroscope sensor and for two encoders; all that controlled by an arduino pro micro that receives the data and sends it via I2C to the main controller in the motor board. It has some extra connectors to link possible future sensors. Its dimensions are 54mm x 71mm 
It’s fitted into a PLA-made box in which most of the sensors are kept. The box has from one to three holes in each side designed to fit in the HC04 and a motor as well as an extra hole to make the arduino cable able to reach the pro micro connector. It has been designed to be compatible with Lego, so it could be used as a functional piece. Its dimensions are 87.80mm x 32.80mm x 71.80mm.

Chasis design

To carry out this project we have created a chassis from Lego Mindstorm Robot Inventor pieces and 3D prints designed by ourselves.
The first challenge was to design a steering system, since we needed a system as precise as possible, within the capabilities of Lego. To resolve that we made an Ackerman steering system, which allows us to make tight turns without the wheels slipping. Linked to this we have some 3D prints, designed to be able to join with Lego pieces. These serve to support and unite all the sensors and plates of the robot, in addition to work as the base of the chassis. Finally, at the front, we have two fixed wheels with an encoder sensor on each, aided by 3D printing to read the wheel turns.
